# Changelog

All notable changes to Scorekeeper are documented here, newest first. Versions
match the in-app "Scorekeeper vX.X" label (Settings panel). Reconstructed from
git history — dates are commit dates, and entries bundle the commits that
landed between one version bump and the next.

## v16.9 - 2026-07-16
- Show Bonus Item/NJCB minuses and the resulting adjusted score in the Score Audit's Guess/Diff tiles, so it's clear why Diff isn't just Score − Guess.
- Add a drop shadow under the Score Audit's sticky team-name header so it visibly separates from content scrolling beneath it.
- Rework the mobile scores panel's drop shadow (docked and expanded) into three directional layers so the top/left/right edges actually show a visible glow in both themes, instead of a symmetric blur that mostly bled off past the narrow side margins.
- Split the Score Audit into two columns on desktop (Round 1/2/Halftime Bonus, then Round 3/4/Final Wager), with Grand Total and everything after it spanning both columns.
- Lower the desktop/mobile layout breakpoint from 900px to 768px — 900 was flipping ordinary laptop windows into the mobile single-column layout (and disabling the Final Results hover magnifying glass) well before they actually ran out of room.

## v16.8 - 2026-07-16
- Collapse the mobile scores sheet down to the docked panel's own height (instead of sliding fully offscreen) so it fades away right where the peek strip/timer are, instead of briefly overlapping them.
- Recenter the timer's reset icon, which sat visibly low in its button.
- Add a sticky "Settings" header in the mobile settings panel, and fix touch-scrolling inside it (especially with Advanced Settings expanded).
- Fix the round-progress bar occasionally detaching from the top and scrolling away with the page on mobile.
- Remove the whole-row hover highlight in Final Results and rely on the magnifying glass alone as the hover cue.
- Fix the Score Audit correct/incorrect breakdown to include the Round 1/3 Beer Round bonus answers and the Round 2/4 Halftime/Final wagers (26 questions total), not just the 16 regular round questions.

## v16.7 - 2026-07-16
- Hide the stray native file-picker button that was rendering on the main page (missing display:none on the new App Preferences file input).
- Widen the mobile docked scores peek strip and narrow the deployed scores sheet so their widths match instead of the sheet flaring out wider when opened.

## v16.6 - 2026-07-16
- Move Session Data save/load back to the header toolbar; keep only App Preferences in Advanced Settings.
- Add the final score guess and its difference below Grand Total in Score Audit.
- Restyle the timer's Pause button as a gold outline instead of a solid gold fill.

## v16.5 - 2026-07-16
- Fix the sticky round-progress bar changing height as its text changes between "in progress" and "all rounds scored".
- Reserve space for the timer's minus sign so it stops jumping in width once the countdown goes past 0:00.
- Add a Timer Pulse toggle in Advanced Settings to turn off the timer's low-time flashing.
- Add a way to save/load just app preferences (theme, size, timer settings, etc.) separately from a full game session.
- Move Session Data and App Preferences save/load buttons from the header into Advanced Settings.
- Lighten the "closer" tiebreaker badge's green on Final Results so its text passes WCAG AA.
- Add an overall correct/incorrect breakdown (count + percentage) under Grand Total in Score Audit.

## v15.6 - 2026-07-13
- Add a live correct/incorrect breakdown (count + percentage) for each question and for the halftime/final wager, updating in real time as teams are graded.

## v15.5 - 2026-07-10
- Inset the mobile scores peek strip to match the section box width and add breathing room between the last section and the peek strip when scrolling.

## v15.3 - 2026-07-10
- Split the Round 2/4 bonus wager header onto two lines instead of shrinking its font.
- Move the craft prize's golden background/border to the whole drawing section instead of just the winner line.

## v15.2 - 2026-07-10
- Round the mobile scores peek strip's corners and fix chevron/text size mismatches.
- Responsive-shrink the Round 2/4 wager header text.
- Add a golden beer-round background for dark mode and for the craft prize winner.
- Rename the settings close button to CLOSE.

## v15.1 - 2026-07-10
- Hide the standings chevron on desktop.
- Color-fill the result ✓/✕ buttons to match the wager buttons.

## v15.0 - 2026-07-10

- Add theme-aware panel shadows, a drumroll countdown, a draggable scores tab, and craft partner/town autocomplete.
- Fix scroll jump on collapse.

## v13.2 - 2026-07-06
- Swap Final Results' mobile Guess/Diff to inline mini-labels (e.g. "G 23 | D +4") instead of a labeled-sentence layout.
- Change Craft Prize's Clear button to a small rounded X so it fits alongside the winner's name; long names wrap onto a second line.
- Enlarge the small X used to remove a team.
- Rework the mobile Final Results Guess/Diff pairing to stay tightly and consistently spaced regardless of digit count.

## v13.0 - 2026-07-05
- Trim the standings sort controls down to Entry and Random on the before-halftime/before-final-wager scoreboards.
- Shorten the Q5 titles (Round 1/3 now reads "0-4 x 5 PTS"; Round 2/4 just shows its point range).
- Swap the Final Results column head to "| DIFF | / GUESS *".
- Collapse the tie-break/Diff explanation under Final Results into a "› Details" disclosure by default.
- Make the Craft Prize Drawing note name the excluded teams instead of just stating a count.
- Drop the "next question" banter from Q5 Bonus/Bonus Wager/Final Wager since they lead into a new round.
- Add a green "all answers finished" left-accent to Q5 Bonus questions; thicken that and the Beer Round gold accent from 3px to 6px.
- Split the merged Guess/Diff cell in Final Results back into two columns with a divider, keeping the +/- sign on Diff.
- Add an Advanced Settings "Edit Locked Fields" toggle to fix a typo in Event Details after scoring starts.
- Widen the Quiz ID format to also accept 4-letter/4-digit codes (e.g. ABCD-1234).
- Fix the beer-round highlight border color across themes.

## v12.0 - 2026-07-05
- Raise the header above the drag handle so the settings overlay doesn't get poked through.
- Give section/sidebar/question headers a distinct background; give every DONE/left/beer-round badge a matching stroke border and larger font for WCAG AA contrast in every theme and color-vision mode.
- Swap the beer-round badge/border to the AA-safe golden token everywhere it appears.
- Rework the halftime/final-wager standings into a narrower centered table with real vertical columns.

- Make the whole title row (not just the chevron) collapse that section; move its banter/sort buttons inside the collapsible area.
- Add the same banter treatment to Q5 Bonus and Bonus/Final Wager sections.
- Trim DONE/left/beer-round badges so they no longer make their header row taller.
- Keep Final Results column headers visible on mobile.
- Force a synthetic mousemove after every re-render so the cursor doesn't get stuck on the default arrow after a tap replaces the DOM.
